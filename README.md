# Finance

This repo contains the work I've done in my free time to better understand what finance is and how capital markets work. 

It all started from the [Khan Academy's course on finance](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance) and from my need to keep track of what I was learning. I then started adding sections about other related topics (macroeconomics, recent facts).

I hope someone will find it useful as I do.
